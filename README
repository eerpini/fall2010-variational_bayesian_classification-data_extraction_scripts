This repository contains all the files that have been used during fall 2010 for the independent study on machine learning. This involved performing variational bayesian multibit classification using some know data on metal oxide structures. The code mainly consists of Python scripts. The work is complete and hence I am making the scripts public, though they are simple code, if anyone wants to have a look at the code they can. Note that most of the code across many of the included scripts is actually redundant (a lot of common code) since I worked on the scripts improvising from an earlier script each time. You will also find some R functions which I wrote for performing classification tasks using R.
